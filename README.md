# Citrus-Fruit-Disease-Detection
Citrus fruits are a vital component of the global agricultural economy and a significant source of nutrition for millions worldwide. However, diseases threaten citrus production, causing substantial economic losses and impacting food security. Rapid and accurate detection of diseases in citrus fruits is crucial for effective disease management and crop preservation.
This project aims to address the challenge of citrus fruit disease detection using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the power of deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we have developed a robust and scalable solution for automated disease identification in citrus fruits.
## Key Features:

#### Dataset Preparation: 
We curated a comprehensive dataset comprising images of healthy citrus fruits and those infected with various diseases. The dataset encompasses diverse conditions and manifestations of citrus diseases to ensure model robustness.

#### Model Architecture: 
Our deep learning model is built upon state-of-the-art CNN architectures, optimized for image classification tasks. We employed transfer learning techniques to fine-tune pre-trained models, enhancing performance and efficiency.

#### Training Pipeline: 
The training pipeline involves data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluation. We utilized techniques such as data augmentation to enhance model generalization and alleviate issues related to dataset scarcity.

#### Deployment: 
The trained model is deployed as a user-friendly application or service, enabling stakeholders, including farmers and agricultural experts, to easily assess citrus fruit health. The deployment infrastructure ensures scalability and accessibility across various platforms.

#### Performance Evaluation: 
We extensively evaluated the model's performance on unseen data, employing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we conducted comparative analyses against existing methods to validate the superiority of our approach.
